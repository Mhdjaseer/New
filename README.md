# Django Rest Framework  Using React js 

1. Django Rest Framework (DRF):
Django Rest Framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django, a high-level Python web framework. It provides tools and libraries for easily creating RESTful APIs with features like serialization, authentication, permissions, and more. DRF is known for its simplicity and productivity, making it a popular choice for building API-driven applications.

2. React.js:
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to build reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application state. React.js follows a component-based approach, where UI elements are composed of reusable components. It provides a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for efficient rendering and offers features like one-way data flow, declarative syntax, and component reusability.
